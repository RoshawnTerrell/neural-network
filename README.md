This is an idea i started working on about a year ago. My intuition told me that it might be possible to layer 'deeper' than we normally layer in neural networks. My intuition was later confirmed with the recent advancement of capsule networks which is essentially the idea that I was trying to implement. Though I think capsule networks still don't fully encapsulate the idea that I was trying to bring forth. As capsule networks stop only at level 2 layering, where as I theorize that it's possible to layer much deeper, possibly infinitely.
